# Staff Hours ðŸ“…
{: .fs-7 .fw-400 }

To attend office hours, put your name on the queue by adding a comment to the Ed megathread for that day's office hours. You can find the megathread as a pinned post on the discussion board.

## Expectations:
Office hours are meant to help students who're stuck - this means explaining problems that were confusing, giving helpful hints for certain challenging parts, and much more. It does not mean that the answer will be handed to you if you attend them. Please don't pester tutors to write things for you or give you the answer, they're there to help you learn, not to get the grade you want.
Also, note that tutors try to help everyone who attends their hours, but they're constrained by time and may not be able to spend that long per student or get to every student that attended. These are rare occurrences, but they are definitely possible, so please be patient and understanding. Take advantage of office hours throughout the week to avoid instances like this.

## Rules to Office Hours:
* You should not go to OH for the purpose of checking your answers.
* You should work independently after getting help (guidance or hints) instead of asking tutors to debug your entire assignment. 
* You are welcome to come back with another ticket if you are getting stuck again, but you should not submit it immediately after your first one.
