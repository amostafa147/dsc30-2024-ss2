Hi, Iâ€™m Tim Liu, a second-year Computer Engineering major with a minor in Mathematics from Shenzhen, China. During my free time, I enjoy playing chess and hiking. This is my first time tutoring for DSC 30. Feel free to come to my office hours if you need any help. Looking forward to meeting you all!
