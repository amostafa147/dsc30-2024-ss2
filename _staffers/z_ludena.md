Hi! My name is Zoe. I am a third-year student in Revelle College with a Data Science major and Business Economics minor. This is my first time tutoring DSC30, but I have tutored DSC10. I’m super excited to meet you all! I am the Social Chair for Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) and participate in E4E’s Acoustic Species research. In my remaining free time I like to bake and sing. Feel free to ask me questions about anything (research, school, major, etc.), as I am happy to help! :D
