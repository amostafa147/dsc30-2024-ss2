Hi everyone! My name is Henry and I am a 3rd year majoring in Data Science and Economics. Iâ€™m originally from JiaXing, China, then I went to high school in Spokane, WA. In my free time I enjoy skiing and playing video games. This is my third time tutoring dsc30 and I am really excited to meet and work with you all!
