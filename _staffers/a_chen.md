Hi everyone! I am Andrew, a third year Data Science Student. I am from the Bay Area and I love to cook, surf and rock climb! This is my second time tutoring for DSC 30 and I know Java can be very confusing and challenging at times. So feel free to come by my OH with any range questions basic to complex. I am always happy to help :)
