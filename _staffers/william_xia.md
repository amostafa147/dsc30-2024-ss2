Hello! My name is William and I'm a third-year majoring in Data Science and minoring in Cognitive Science. Outside of school, I enjoy exploring nature, playing basketball, and watching kdramas. This will be my first time tutoring but I'm excited to work with everyone! Feel free to contact me or come to my office hours if you have any questions :)
