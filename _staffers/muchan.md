Hi, I'm Muchan. I'm entering my final year studying data science and cognitive science. I do research (loosely) in data and privacy topics, and I'm obsessed with learning and working with new web frameworks and cloud-based technologies. Hit me up if your are interested too! This will be my 4th time tutoring DSC30, and 5th time working with Marina. Definitely don't hesitate to throw your questions at me as it is always my pleasure to see new faces, learn, and grow with you. Outside of academics, I go jim 💪 and hoop 🏀. Excited to meet you all in my office hours and lectures (when I occasionally show up :)
