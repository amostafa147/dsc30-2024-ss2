Hi, I'm Muchan. I'm entering my final year studying data science and cognitive science. This will be my 4th time tutoring DSC30, and 5th time working with Marina. Don't hesitate to throw your questions at me as it is always my pleasure to see new faces, learn, and grow with you. Outside of academics, I go jim 💪 and hoop 🏀. Excited to meet you all in my office hours and lectures (when I occasionally show up :)
