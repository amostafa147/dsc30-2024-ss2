Intro: Greetings again, I'm Huaning and I'm currently a 4th year student major in Applied Math and Data Science. My current interest is asymptotic theory in Statistics. DSC30 gives a rigorous intro to Java, which could be helpful for your future data/software experiences. See you then in class and OH :)
