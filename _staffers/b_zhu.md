Hi everyone! This is Bobby and Iâ€™m a 2nd-year data science major. I grew up in Beijing, China, and finished my high school in Philadelphia. In my free time, I like baking, watching movies, and playing board games with my friends. Feel free to come to my office-hour if you have any questions or just for a casual talk~
