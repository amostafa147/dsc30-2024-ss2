Hi!! Iâ€™m Jessica Hung and I am currently a second-year double majoring in Mathematics joint Economics and Data Science. I was born in Taiwan, but grew up in Shanghai. I really like cooking and watching NBA in my own free time. I look forward to seeing you all this quarter! Feel free to come to my office hours if you have any questions or simply want to chat!
