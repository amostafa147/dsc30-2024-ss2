Hello, my name is Ahmed. I am a second-year data science major. This is my first time tutoring here at UCSD, so I am really excited and looking forward to meeting all of you guys. In my free time, I love playing soccer and visiting my family. Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions!
