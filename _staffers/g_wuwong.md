Hi there! I'm Gahn Wuwong, and I'm a second-year Data Science major. I'm from Bangkok, and I enjoy playing badminton and Overwatch in my free time. This is my first time tutoring, and I'm thrilled to help you guys go through DSC 30. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, and I look forward to meeting each one of you!
