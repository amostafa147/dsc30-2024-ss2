Hello everyone, my name is Yuri and this is my last quarter doing Data Science and Linguistics here at UCSD. I am originally from Russia, but have been living in SD for several years. I've been tutoring this class several times, and I am really excited to keep assisting students; I plan to become a teacher after I graduate, that's how much I loved tutoring for DSC classes! I am a huge gamer and I really love making art in my free time. Let's hope for a great spring quarter!
