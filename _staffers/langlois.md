Hello! :wave: My name is Suh Young (not Suh)! I'm originally from Northeast Arkansas, but I've been living in Seattle for the past few years since I'm currently doing my Masters degree at the University of Washington. I've worn several hats in UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering for nigh three years now (first as a student, then as a teaching assistant, a research assistant, and at one point an instructor), and I'm excited to be your instructor for Summer Session II! 

My background is in Statistics, Computer Science, and Classics (of the Greek and Roman variety), and I love exploring the intersection of computational methods, data programming, and literature! Data Structures and Algorithms was one of my favorite classes during my bygone undergraduate years, and I hope to pass along as much of that as I can. I'm always more than happy to chat about the interdisciplinary nature of data science, computing, and other fields. Feel free to stop by office hours anytime, whether it's about course content or you'd just like to chat!
