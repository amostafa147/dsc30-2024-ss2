Hi, I am Marina and I am originally from Russia (not France!). I moved to Chicago to continue my education and I earned my PhD in Computer Science from UIC. Then I worked at Yeshiva University, NYC and then moved to UCSD< San Diego. I was a member of CS department at first but them moved to Data Science and I am loving it! I am excited to be your instructor for this quarter and you are welcome to stop by just to chat :)

Fun fact: I play ping pong!ðŸ’ƒ
