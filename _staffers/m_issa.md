Hi everyone, I am a third year Math-CS major. Besides doing research, I like playing soccer, basketball, and watching movies. This is my first time tutoring in the Data Science department, and I am excited to meet everyone. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you are stuck. Looking forward to seeing you all!
