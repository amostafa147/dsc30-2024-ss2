Hi, I'm Lucas, and I'm excited to be one of your tutors for 30 this quarter! As a 4th-year Data Science Major, having previously tutored for DSC 30, 40B, and 80, I look forward to sharing my knowledge and insights with you! Outside the classroom, I enjoy staying active at the gym, playing video games (league/apex), and exploring new productivity techniques â€” currently, I'm delving into building a "second brain." Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns, and let's work towards achieving your academic goals!
