Hi everyone! This is Yunyi and I am a 4th year student double majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science. This quarter is my fourth time tutoring this course, and I would say it is one of the most important and useful classes I have taken in college. I hope you all would enjoy this class, and feel free to come to my OH if you have any questions.
