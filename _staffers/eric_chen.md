Hi everyone! My name is Eric and I am currently a second year Data Science major from OC. I’m a big K-Pop fan (been listening to Seventeen lately) and a foodie, so I’m probably going to be watching a bunch of content related to those two things if I am not focused on schoolwork. This is my first time tutoring DSC30, so I am really excited to be a part of this class with you all and I hope that we can learn a lot from each other!
