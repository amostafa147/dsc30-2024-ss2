Hi everyone! I am Yulin Chen. I am a second-year Data Science and Math-CS major student. This is my second time tutoring, and I am still really excited. I will do my best to help you and I am sure that you will enjoy the fun of DSC 30. During my free time, I like to play badminton and League of Legends. Looking forward to meet and work with you all!
