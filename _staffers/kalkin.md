Hi everyone! I am Kalkin and I am a second year Computer Engineering and Math major in Revelle College. I’m from the bay area and I like board games, live music, and solving fun math problems. This is my fourth time tutoring for this class and I’m looking forward to getting to know everyone this quarter!
