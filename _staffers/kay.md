Hi all, Iâ€™m Kay, a fourth year Social Psychology major (not a typo) minoring Data Science. This will be my third quarter teaching this class under Marina, so please do not hesitate to ask me anything about this class! Some facts about me: I was born in Tokyo, but grew up in Shanghai; I started playing Valorant recently and I am consistently a bottom fragger; I am also into photography and is now broke due to purchasing too much camera gears. Anyhow, I am really excited about this quarter and hoping to see everyone in office hours!
