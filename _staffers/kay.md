Hi all! I’m Kay, a graduated fourth year Social Psychology major minoring Data Science. This will be my fifth quarter tutoring this class. I speak Mandarin and Japanese aside from English. During my spare time I play rhythm games and do photography while budget allows. I am looking forward to making connections with y’all, and please do not hesitate to come find me in my office hours!
