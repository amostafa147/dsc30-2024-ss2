Hi, I’m Deepika! I’m a second year data science major from San Jose. My hobbies include eating spicy noodles, taking candids of my friends, rewatching podcasts (which is where my picture is from!!), and thinking about the past. This is my first time tutoring DSC 30, so I’m really excited to meet everyone!
