Hello I’m Andrew! I am a fourth year Data Science Major and this is my third time tutoring for DSC 30! I’m from the bay and I like to bake cakes as a hobby. My fav is cheesecake!! I also picked up surfing while at UCSD so you might see me in the middle of the ocean during OH. Good luck with the quarter you guys got this :)) feel free to drop by with any questions!
