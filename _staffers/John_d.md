Hi, I'm John! I'm a third year majoring in Data Science with minors in Math and Business. In my free time I do competitive hip hop and I like to read and bullet journal. This is my second time tutoring DSC 30, and I'm so excited to work with you all this quarter. I'm happy to help with any of your questions :)
