DSC 30! This course introduces you to the foundations of programming in Java, data structures and algorithms. In particular, DSC 30 is the second class in the series taught in Java and covers data structures including: Stacks, Queues, Arrays, Lists, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Binary Search Trees, Balanced Trees, Heaps. This class also covers sorting algorithms such as Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick and Heap.</p><p>Prerequisites: DSC 20.</p><hr /><h2 id="communication-"> <a href="#communication-" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="communication-"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Communication 💬</h2><p>This quarter, we’ll be using <a href="https://edstem.org/us/join/Fahv9s">Edstem</a> as our course message board. You will be added to Ed at the beginning of the quarter. If you’re not able to access it please self enroll using the given link above, as we’ll be making <strong>all course announcements</strong> through it.</p><p>If you have a question about anything to do with the course — if you’re stuck on a assignment problem, want clarification on the logistics, or just have a general question about data science — you can make a post on Ed. We only ask that if your question includes some or all of your code, please make your post <strong>private</strong> so that others cannot see it. You can also post anonymously if you would prefer.</p><p>Course staff will regularly check Ed and try to answer any questions that you have. You’re also encouraged to answer a question asked by another student if you feel that you know the answer!</p><hr /><h2 id="technology-"> <a href="#technology-" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="technology-"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Technology 🖥</h2><p>We will be using several websites this quarter.

After you read the comments, if you still believe the grader made a mistake, we will regrade your whole assignment strictly. For example, if you had a magic number that the grader didn’t catch before, you will lose points for it after you get your style points back where the grader made a mistake.</p><h4 id="compile-error-regrade"> <a href="#compile-error-regrade" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="compile-error-regrade"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> <strong>Compile error regrade</strong></h4><p>If your submitted files did not compile, and Gradescope showed</p><blockquote><p>SUBMISSION FAILED.

Make use of the expertise of the staff to learn what you need to know to really do well in the course. Act with integrity, and don’t cheat.</strong></p><p>If you do cheat, we will enforce the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship. This means: You might fail the course and the Dean of your college will put you on probation or suspend or dismiss you from UCSD.</p><p>Why is academic integrity important? Academic integrity is an issue that should be important to all students on campus. When students act unethically by copying someone’s work, taking an exam for someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades and for the University to give degrees that reflect student knowledge. This devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it important for the entire campus to band together and enforce that all members of this community are honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD!</p><p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmaeweb.ucsd.edu%2Fundergrad%2Fcourses%2Fintegrity&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGlz4x5OEvugccWorxKhK4-fpoE8w">Jacobs School of Engineering Code of Academic Integrity</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Facademicintegrity.ucsd.edu%2Fprocess%2Fpolicy.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3SXZNVviORdYbRcypRot-WcJk0g">the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship</a> and this syllabus list some of the standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations.</p><p><strong>What counts as cheating?</strong></p><p>In DSC 30, you can read books, surf the web, talk to your friends and the DSC 30 staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete your assignments. However, all code must be written by you, together with your partner if you choose to have one (when allowed). Note that a partner is allowed <strong>only</strong> when we explicitly say that groupwork is allowed for a particular assignment. Most assignments in this course must be completed individually.</p><p>The following activities are considered cheating and ARE <strong>NOT ALLOWED</strong> in DSC 30 (This is not an exhaustive list):</p><ul><li><p>Using or submitting code acquired from other students (except your partner, when allowed), the web, or any other resource not officially sanctioned by this course</p><li><p>Having any other student complete any part of your assignment on your behalf</p><li><p>Acquiring exam questions or answers prior to taking an exam</p><li><p>Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else</p><li><p>Providing code, exam questions, or solutions to any other student in the course</p><li><p>Using any external resource on closed-book exams</p><li><p>The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and ARE ALLOWED in DSC 20:</p><li><p>Discussing the general approach to solving homework problems or a final project (when given)</p><li><p>Talking about debugging strategies or debugging issues you ran into and how you solved them</p><li><p>Discussing the answers to exams with other students who have already taken the exam after the exam is complete</p><li><p>Using code provided in class, by the textbook or any other assigned reading or video, with attribution</p><li><p>Google searching for documentation on Python</p></ul><p><strong>How can I be sure that my actions are NOT considered cheating?</strong></p><p>To ensure that you don’t encounter any problems, here are some suggestions for completing your work.</p><ul><li><p>Don’t look at or discuss the details of another student’s code for an assignment you are working on, and don’t let another student look at your code.</p><li><p>Don’t start with someone else’s code and make changes to it, or in any way share code with other students.</p><li><p>If you are talking to another student about an assignment, don’t take notes, and wait an hour afterward before you write any code.</p></ul><p>Note: in the discussion above, we are talking about other students that are not your pair programming partner. See the pair programming guidelines for information on working with a partner.</p><p>Remember, Academic Integrity is about doing your part to act with Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility and Courage.</p><hr /><h2 id="support-"> <a href="#support-" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="support-"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Support 🫂</h2><h3 id="accommodations"> <a href="#accommodations" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="accommodations"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Accommodations</h3><p>Students requesting accommodations for this course due to a disability or current functional limitation must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the <a href="https://osd.ucsd.edu">Office for Students with Disabilities</a> (OSD).
