    "title": "Style Requirements",
    "content": "You will be graded for the style of programming on this assignment. A few key requirements for style are given below. Here is a complete Java style guide: Java Style Guide written by Alan Yao from UC Berkeley. We will test you on a smaller set of rules: . Line Limit . No line may be longer than 100 characters (the number of characters &lt;= 100). Names . | Names of static final constants must be in all capitals (e.g., RED, DEFAULT_NAME). | Names of parameters, local variables, and methods must start with a lower-case letter, or consist of a single, upper-case letter. (e.g., maxLength, N, index, getWidth). | Names of types (classes), including type parameters, must start with a capital letter (e.g., SampleClass, LinkedList). | Give all your variable name that describe its meaning and purpose to make your code readable. (For loop variables, it is fine to use i, j, k) | Avoid ‚Äúmagic numbers‚Äù (numbers other than -1, 0, 1) in code by giving them meaningful symbolic names (variable names such as ‚Äúhundred‚Äù, ‚Äútwo‚Äù, ‚Äúthree‚Äù are not allowed) and defining them as private static final constants at the top of the class. | . Indentation &amp; Whitespaces . | The basic indentation step is 4 spaces. (Do not use horizontal tab characters for indentation.) | Don‚Äôt mix tabs and spaces. | Each file must end with a newline sequence. | Indent code by the basic indentation step for each block level (blocks are generally enclosed in ‚Äú{‚Äú and ‚Äú}‚Äù). | . Comments . | Include a comment of your name and PID at the top of every file. | Each class should have javadoc comments briefly explaining the purpose of the class, @author, and @since. | Each method should have javadoc comments explaining the behavior, parameters (using @param tag), return type (using @return tag), exception the method throws (using @throws tag). | You should write inline comments for complicated parts of your code to explain the logic of your code. | . Example SampleClass.java file: . /* * NAME: First Last * PID: Axxxxxxxx */ import java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException; /** * Description of Sample Class * * @author First Last * @since ${date} */ class SampleClass { /* Declare constants and magic numbers */ private static final int MAX_SIZE = 100; private int instanceVariable; /** * Description of constructor * @param para Description of para */ public SampleClass(int para) { // inline comment here to explain complicated logic to make your code readable instanceVariable = para; } /** * Description of method * * @param para1 Description of para1 * @param para2 Description of para2 * @return Description of return value * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException when this exception is thrown */ public int sampleMethod(int para1, int para2) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException { } } . Exceptions: We will not deduct points if magic numbers appear in your code in the following scenarios . 1. Checking for mod `n`, where `n` can be any number. You don't have to make a variable for the number `n`.&lt;br&gt; ```py number_to_check % 2 == 0 # Example for mod 2 number_to_check % 3 == 0 # Example for mod 3 ``` 2. The distance formula (2D &amp; 3D examples are given, but the distance formula is ok for any dimension N). ```py a ** 2 = b ** 2 + c ** 2 # 2D distance formula d ** 2 = x1 ** 2 + x2 ** 2 + x3 ** 2 # 3D distance formula ``` 3. Root formulas such as square root, cube root, etc. ```py square_root = a_number ** (1/2) cube_root = a_number ** (1/3) ``` . ",

Therefore I will use in-class polls as well as pre-released worksheets to work out different problems with students. It is strongly encouraged that everyone attends lecture sessions for more effective learning. | To earn credit you need to answer at least 50% of the questions. | I will drop 3 participations for everyone. | First class does not count towards your participation. | You can recover misssed lecture with discussion activities. | . Readings (9%) . To prepare you for class sections, there will be required readings and/or video watching assignments to be completed before each lecture. You demonstrate your completion of reading assignments by submitting online reading quizzes for each class (except midterms and holidays). | Reading quizzes will be provided online via Canvas or Zybook Activity. | You can submit each quiz multiple times: 3 attempts for Canvas quizzes and unlimited attempts for Zybook activities. | Lowest 3 quizzes will be dropped for the quarter. | Deadline to submit them is Friday 11:59pm, it is strongly recommended that you complete the reading assignments before each lecture. | Late readings will lose 10% per day after the deadline. | This category is capped at 100%. | . Programming Assignments (40%) . | PAs are released every week on the course schedule page. | You may turn in your code as many times as you like before the deadline, but only the most recent submission will be graded, so it‚Äôs a good habit to submit early and often. | If not specified, all assignments must be done individually. | Deadline: Specified on the write-up (usually Mondays). | You are allowed to submit the assignments late 5 times (you have 5 slip days). Can‚Äôt use more than 1 slip day per assignment. | None of the programming assignments will be dropped. | This category is capped at 100%. | . Exams (50%) . There will be three exams this quarter: . | Midterm 1 and 2 (10% each): during lectures, in person. | Final (30%): June 10 (Saturday), 11:30am-2:30pm, in person. Location TBA. | This category is also capped at 100%. | . Exam Redemption Policy . The final will be split into 3 parts: midterm1, midterm2, and new material. We offer midterm redemption opportunities only for those who have taken both midterm exams. You could replace your midterm score (not the final exam part) with the score you earn for the counterpart on the final exam (i.e. maximum between midterm1 score (%) and final-part1 (%), maximum between midterm2 score (%) and final-part2 (%) ). If you simply miss a midterm without notifing me, you are NOT eligible for this redemption policy. | You can‚Äôt skip any part of the final regardless of your midterms score. The entire exam needs to be taken. | You must score at least 55% on the final exam to pass the course. If you score lower than 55% on the final, you will receive an F in the course, regardless of your overall average. | . ",

For example, if you had a magic number that the grader didn‚Äôt catch before, you will lose points for it after you get your style points back where the grader made a mistake. Compile error regrade . If your submitted files did not compile, and Gradescope showed . SUBMISSION FAILED.

    "title": "COLLABORATION POLICY AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ùó",
    "content": "The basic rule for DSC 30 is: Work hard. Make use of the expertise of the staff to learn what you need to know to really do well in the course. Act with integrity, and don‚Äôt cheat. If you do cheat, we will enforce the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship. This means: You might fail the course and the Dean of your college will put you on probation or suspend or dismiss you from UCSD. Why is academic integrity important? Academic integrity is an issue that should be important to all students on campus. When students act unethically by copying someone‚Äôs work, taking an exam for someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades and for the University to give degrees that reflect student knowledge. This devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it important for the entire campus to band together and enforce that all members of this community are honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD! . The Jacobs School of Engineering Code of Academic Integrity, the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and this syllabus list some of the standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations. What counts as cheating? . In DSC 30, you can read books, surf the web, talk to your friends and the DSC 30 staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete your assignments. However, all code must be written by you, together with your partner if you choose to have one (when allowed). Note that a partner is allowed only when we explicitly say that groupwork is allowed for a particular assignment. Most assignments in this course must be completed individually. The following activities are considered cheating and ARE NOT ALLOWED in DSC 30 (This is not an exhaustive list): . | Using or submitting code acquired from other students (except your partner, when allowed), the web, or any other resource not officially sanctioned by this course . | Having any other student complete any part of your assignment on your behalf . | Acquiring exam questions or answers prior to taking an exam . | Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else . | Providing code, exam questions, or solutions to any other student in the course . | Using any external resource on closed-book exams . | The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and ARE ALLOWED in DSC 20: . | Discussing the general approach to solving homework problems or a final project (when given) . | Talking about debugging strategies or debugging issues you ran into and how you solved them . | Discussing the answers to exams with other students who have already taken the exam after the exam is complete . | Using code provided in class, by the textbook or any other assigned reading or video, with attribution . | Google searching for documentation on Python . | . How can I be sure that my actions are NOT considered cheating? . To ensure that you don‚Äôt encounter any problems, here are some suggestions for completing your work. | Don‚Äôt look at or discuss the details of another student‚Äôs code for an assignment you are working on, and don‚Äôt let another student look at your code. | Don‚Äôt start with someone else‚Äôs code and make changes to it, or in any way share code with other students. | If you are talking to another student about an assignment, don‚Äôt take notes, and wait an hour afterward before you write any code. | . Note: in the discussion above, we are talking about other students that are not your pair programming partner. See the pair programming guidelines for information on working with a partner.
